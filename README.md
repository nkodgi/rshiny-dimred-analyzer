## 🎯 Purpose

We developed a user-friendly **R Shiny application** that allows anyone—regardless of coding experience—to perform **dimensionality reduction** and **statistical analysis** on any dataset. 

To demonstrate the app, we used the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset** (569 samples, 30 features), enabling users to apply a range of techniques including **PCA**, **Sparse PCA**, **Kernel PCA**, **MDS**, and **t-SNE**. Among these, *t-SNE* provided the clearest separation between **benign** and **malignant** tumors.

The app also features statistical tools such as:
- ✅ **Welch’s t-tests**
- 📏 **Confidence interval calculations**
- 📊 **Visualizations (e.g., box plots)**

These tools revealed that **tumor size-related features** showed the strongest group differences, highlighting their importance in diagnosis. This app is ideal for clinicians, biologists, and researchers handling **high-dimensional biomedical data**.
